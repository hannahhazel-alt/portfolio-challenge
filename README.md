# portfolio-challenge

## Description 

I wanted to create this portfolio because it best showcases my work for when I apply to jobs. This could potenailly set me apart from other candidates by utilising everything I have learnt on my course so far. This interactive portfolio takes anyone who interats with it to different projects that I have worked on so far. 
I wanted to build this portfolio to test my knowledge, learn more about grids, flexbox and media quieries while ultising them to the best of my ability to showcase work. 
I didn't have a portfolio imbedded in HTML and CSS that I built before so this gives me a great starting off point towards my career and with applying to jobs. It helps me be more prepared for interviews because I know I can solve the technical issues of any portion of interviews.
I learnt how grids work and areas where I need to improve on my knowledge for next time. While I was searching for answers to many different things, I also learnt how to send a href email link straight to someones email to type the email, which I think was really cool. 
I think my project stands out because it's colourful and fun, I didn't want it to look too professional and I feel like you end up blending into the crowd, I also hope that we're moving into a period of time where employers will applaud individuality and creativity which is why I have styled my portfolio... well... very pink.
